# Classic Snake Game

A classic Snake Game built with pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Features:

-   Start and/or restart a game
-   Use arrow keys to move snake
-   Use arrow buttons to move snake

**Credit**: This project was completed in the [Frontend Developer Career Path course on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). The original project was unstyled and was made with basic snake game functionality with just a Start/Restart button. Since completing the game project in Scrimba, I've added more functionality by allowing screen only users (users without a access to a keyboard) to move the snake with arrow buttons on a screen.
